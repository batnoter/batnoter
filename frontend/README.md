### Running the frontend module locally

Before starting the frontend app, please make sure that you have either started the backend module locally or pointed the frontend to staging api-server using proxy configuration.

If you are working only on the frontend changes and do not want to start the backend module locally, you can point the frontend app to staging server for API access.

To point frontend app to the staging api-server, Simply create `.env.development.local` file at the root of the frontend module with below contents.
```shell
REACT_APP_PROXY_API_URL=https://gitnoter-staging.herokuapp.com
```

Then start the frontend react app with below command.
```shell
npm start
```
This will start the react app in the development mode.
